# Agentic AI with LangGraph

A collection of **LangGraph projects** demonstrating the core concepts of **Agentic AI**, including **sequential workflows**, **parallel workflows**, and scalable **multi-agent orchestration**.  
This repository evolves as a **practical notebook hub** for building **AI agents**, **LLM-powered pipelines**, and **workflow automation** using LangGraph.

## Index of Notebooks

1. **[Sequential Workflow in LangGraph](https://github.com/ravirch/Agentic-AI-with-LangGraph/blob/main/Notebooks/Sequential-workflows-in-Langgraph.ipynb)**  
2. **[Parallel Workflow in LangGraph](https://github.com/ravirch/Agentic-AI-with-LangGraph/blob/main/Notebooks/Parallel-Workflow-in-LangGraph.ipynb)**
3. **[Conditional Workflow in LangGraph](https://github.com/ravirch/Agentic-AI-with-LangGraph/blob/main/Notebooks/Conditional-Workflow-in-Langgraph.ipynb)** 

> More notebooks will be added soon! Stay tuned for **branching workflows, hybrid workflows, memory-enabled agents, and end-to-end agentic AI systems**.

## Goals of This Repository
- Serve as a **practical guide to Agentic AI** using LangGraph.  
- Showcase **workflow design patterns** (sequential, parallel, branching, hybrid).  
- Provide **hands-on Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **LangGraph** – workflow orchestration for LLMs and AI agents  
- **Python** – implementation language  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – step-by-step interactive demos  
- **LLMs** – for reasoning and responses
